For context, A.R.T. was a project that I made, which made me realize I was biting off more than I could chew. I was already trying to figure out how to handle big relational data, while also thinking about scalability, while also dealing with multiple users, etc. etc. 

This time around, I'm planning to make it simpler. This project is a simpler version of A.R.T. that aims to help artists get a little break from artblock and get some creative juices flowing. Right now, the app offers 3 main features: artist features, galleries, and prompt generation. 

Overtime, the app can be iterated through in order to be better and better.
